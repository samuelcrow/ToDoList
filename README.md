# ToDo List
The todo list is a customly styled todo list that lets you keep track of the things you need to do.  
## ToDo List  
The todo list is something that I coded with the help of MIT | xPro.  It is an exercise that has helped me to really understand state.  And it's very simple to use.  All you do it type something into the text box, and hit enter.  Once you've finished something on the ToDo list, you can simply press on any of them to delete it.
